# faceid_mobile

Using #MLKit and #Flutter to pre-process user images. The goal is to detect and crop the face in an image and determine 
if it's in the right position, then upload it to a #flask backend that uses the #FaceNet model with #Tensorflow to encode the images.

Github for the backend:[Backend](https://github.com/aymannc/banking-face-id)
